Goals of the slicer:
must be run from the command line
must have a configurable slicer
can have slicer input parnmeters read from an xml file
can save svg slice files
can save image slices
must support multiple printer types
	DLP
	Power
	FDM
		Plastic
		Ceramic

must support a wide variety of slice modules
	each slice module works on data local to the slicer
Each Module is aware of other slicer modules?
	I'd like to have a discussion about this here. Does it make more sense to have each slicer module know 
	nothing about other modules. or should each module be able to access data from others,

	I.E. An example of this may be that 'Bottom' module. The Bottom module will modify the lower layers, and tag them to move slower,
	or to have a solid infill.

	Is there a solid example of where modules need to be aware of modules parameters?
	Speed example: 
		I have a module named speed,it's job is to set the overall build speed for the model by setting its
		parameters.

Must create GCode for DLP Printers (Z axis GCode and wiper /HBP/ tilt, projector)
Must create FDM GCode for a variety of printers
	RepRap firmware (Serial GCode)
		Sprinter
		Marlin
		?
	Makerbot firmware (Serial GCode + Commands?)
	

Loading and Saving of Slicing files
The goal is to be able to load an stl file and have it produce the folowing:
-png image slices
-a slice file (is this really necessary if image slices are generated?) 
	still need to be able to read/write CLI or similar files
